# K-Nearest-Neighbors-in-Python

## Developed KNN model to predict a class for a new data point based off of the features.

### The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
### It is one of the popular and simplest classification and regression classifiers used in machine learning today.
